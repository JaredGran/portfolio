    <h2 class="jumbotron">Who I am and why I am here</h2>
      <p> My name is <strong>Jared Carper</strong>, I am 20 years old and I live in Oregon. I got into programming because I had stagnated and was doing nothing with my life. Straight out of highschool I got a job working at an Amazon packaging facility. Once I realized Amazon wasn't a right fit for me
        I got a much better job for myself at Estacada's Harvest Market. its been a year or so now and ive thought recently I could do more, so here I am at Epicodus.</p>

      <p>Programming has always interested meeven when I was little. My goals are to find a good job in the gaming industry writting the programs that make people have the fun that I have playing games.
        I believe I can do well, and that one day I'll look back at my decisions in life and be able smile at them and know I did my best. I want a job I can be proud doing.
        and hopefully this helps you understand a bit about me.</p>
