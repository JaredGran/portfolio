    <h2><em>Who I am and why I am here</em></h2>
      <p> My name is Jared Carper, I am 20 years old and I live in Oregon. I got into programing because I had stagnated and was doing nothing with my life. Programming has always interested me
        even when I was little. My goals are to find a good job in the gaming industry writting the programs that make people have the fun that I have playing games.
        I believe I can do well, and that one day I'll look back at my decisions in life and be able smile at them and know I did my best. I want a job I can be proud doing.
        and hopefully this helps you understand a bit about me.</p>
