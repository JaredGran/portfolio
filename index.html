  <h2 class="jumbotron">Who I am and why I am here.</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Jared Carper</strong>, I am 20 years old and I live in Oregon. I got into programming because I had stagnated and was doing nothing with my life. Straight out of high school I got a job working at an Amazon packaging facility. Once I realized Amazon wasn't a right fit for me I got a much better job for myself at Estacada's Harvest Market. It's been a year or so now and I've thought recently I could do more, so here I am at Epicodus.</p>

  <p>Programming has always interested me even when I was little. My goals are to find a good job in the gaming industry writting the programs that make people have the fun that I have playing games. I believe I can do well, and that one day I'll look back at my decisions in life and be able smile at them and know I did my best. I want a job I can be proud doing. And hopefully this helps you understand a bit about me.</p>
